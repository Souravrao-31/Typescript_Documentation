# Typescript

By definition, ‚ÄúTypeScript is JavaScript for application-scale development.‚Äù

In short, TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that has optional typing and compiles to plain JavaScript.

## Features of TypeScript

**TypeScript is just JavaScript**. TypeScript starts with JavaScript and ends with JavaScript. Typescript adopts the basic building blocks of your program from JavaScript. Hence, you only need to know JavaScript to use TypeScript. All TypeScript code is converted into its JavaScript equivalent for the purpose of execution.

**TypeScript supports other JS libraries**. Compiled TypeScript can be consumed from any JavaScript code. TypeScript-generated JavaScript can reuse all of the existing JavaScript frameworks, tools, and libraries.

**JavaScript is TypeScript**. This means that any valid **.js** file can be renamed to **.ts** and compiled with other TypeScript files.

**TypeScript is portable**. TypeScript is portable across browsers, devices, and operating systems. It can run on any environment that JavaScript runs on. Unlike its counterparts, TypeScript doesn‚Äôt need a dedicated VM or a specific runtime environment to execute.

### What do I need to learn to use TypeScript?

TypeScript is essentially a JS linter. Or, JS with documentation that the compiler can understand.

Therefore, in contrast to other languages like CoffeeScript (which adds syntactic sugar) or PureScript (which does not look like JavaScript at all), you do not need to learn a lot to start writing TypeScript code.

Types in TS are optional, and every JS file is a valid TypeScript file. While the compiler will complain if you have type errors in your initial files, it does give you back a JavaScript file that *works as it did before*. Wherever you are, TypeScript will meet you there, and it is easy to build up your skills gradually.

### Is TypeScript used on the frontend or the backend?

TypeScript is compiled to JavaScript. Therefore, TS can be used anywhere JS could be used: both the frontend and the backend.

JavaScript is the most popular language to implement scripting for the frontend of apps and web pages. Thus, TypeScript can be used for the very same purpose, but it shines in complex enterprise projects on the server side.



### Types of TypeScript

TypeScript has a variety of basic types, like Boolean, Number, String, Array, Tuple, etc. Some of these don‚Äôt exist in JS.

## Globally Installing TypeScript

It can be handy to have TypeScript available across all projects, often to test one-off ideas. Long-term, codebases should prefer a project-wide installation over a global install so that they can benefit from reproducible builds across different machines.

### via npm

You can use npm to install TypeScript globally, this means that you can use the `tsc` command anywhere in your terminal.

To do this, run `npm install -g typescript`. 



## TypeScript in Your Project

Having TypeScript set up on a per-project basis lets you have many projects with many different versions of TypeScript, this keeps each project working consistently.

### via npm

TypeScript is available as a [package on the npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript) available as `"typescript"`.

You will need a copy of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) as an environment to run the package. Then you use a dependency manager like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/) to download TypeScript into your project.

```
npm install typescript --save-dev
```

npm yarn pnpm

All of these dependency managers support lockfiles, ensuring that everyone on your team is using the same version of the language. You can then run the TypeScript compiler using one of the following commands:

```
npx tsc
```

**Compile**

```tsx
> tsc helloworld.ts
```



# **Enough thoery Lets code**



- ### Static type-checking

[**TypeScript**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript) provides **static typing** through **type** annotations to enable **type** **checking** at compile time.

This is optional and can be ignored to use the regular dynamic **typing** of JavaScript.



# <u>**Name dropping <T>: (terms: T)**</u>

Firstly **‚Äî What is a Type system?**

> A **type system** associates a type with each computed value and, by examining the flow of these values, attempts to **ensure** or prove that no [type errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_error) can occur.

Kind of cool having a **set of rules** aimed to reduce possibilities of bugs isn‚Äôt it?

**Static typing:** Types **checked before run-time** (tracking bugs before shifting your code..).

**Dynamically**-**typed:** Type **checked** mostly at **run time.** (runtime issues are more expensive if missed).

BTW the mix combination of both strongly and weekly typing (like when using ***any\***) is called: ‚Äú**gradual typing**.‚Äù

**Type annotations:** (just a fancy name to something your‚Äôe familiar with..) used to enforce type checking. e.g as is (object with members) or using the type / interface declarations.

```
function drive(driver: {name: string, age: number}, 
               car: { brand: string, maxSpeed: number }) {
}

// OR

type Driver = {name: string, age: number};

// OR 

interface IDriver {
  name: string;
  age: number
}
```

**Structural typing:**

I recently watched the ***TypeScript: Static Types for JavaScrip\***t lecture by ***Anders Hejlsberg\***, it‚Äôs really good and he explains TS as a Structural type system

> **Structural** typing is a way of relating **types** based solely on their members.

Relate types based on their members? The following shows possibly 2 different types but both have the same members thus could be assigned one to the other:

```
interface INode<T> {
  data: string;
  parent: T;
  children: INode<INode<T>>[];
}

type Item<T> = {
  data: string;
  parent: T;
  children: Item<Item<T>>[];
}let foo: INode<null>;
let bar: Item<null>;

foo = bar;
```

> The basic rule for TypeScript‚Äôs structural type system is that `x` is compatible with `y` if `y` has at least the same members as `x.`



### `noImplicitAny`

According to the documentation, the definition of `noImplicitAny` is to ‚Äúraise errors on expressions and declarations with any implied any type.‚Äù

This means that whenever TypeScript can infer a type, you will get an error if you allow `noImplicitAny`. This example can be seen by passing function arguments.



`function print(arg) {`

`send(arg);` 

`}`

`print("hello");`

`print(4);`

In the above code, **what are valid arguments for the `print` function?** If you don‚Äôt add a type to the function argument, TypeScript will assign the argument of type `any`, which will turn off type checking.

For developers who prefer safety in their code, they can utilize `noImplicityAny`, which will notify them of any possibilities for type `any` in their code. Let‚Äôs see what will happen with the same `print` function.

`function print(arg) { // Error : someArg has an implicit any type`

‚Äã    `send(arg);`

`}`

To fix the error, you can annotate the function argument.

`function print(arg: number) { // Error : someArg has an implicit any type`

‚Äã    `send(arg);`

`}`



But if you still want type `any`, you can explicitly mark the argument as `any`.

`function print(arg: any) { // Error : someArg has an implicit any type`

‚Äã    `send(arg);`

`}`

### `unknown`

The `unknown` type is similar to the `any` type in that all types are assignable to the `any` and `unknown` type, but the distinction is that the `any` type is assignable to any other types, but the `unknown` type is un-assignable to any other type. The distinction can be a confusing concept, so let‚Äôs take a look at an example.



`function example1(arg: any) {`

 `const a: str = arg; // no error`

 `const b: num = arg; // no error`

`}`

`function example2(arg: unknown) {`

 `const a: str = arg; // üî¥ Type 'unknown' is not assignable to type 'string'.(2322)`

 `const b: num = arg; // üî¥ Type 'unknown' is not assignable to type 'number'.(2322)`

`}`



A variable `arg` is passed to both functions, which can have a type of `string`, `number`, or another type. No matter its type, `arg` is then assigned the type `any` and `unknown`.

However, unlike the `any` type, a variable of `unknown` type cannot then be assigned to another type, as seen in lines 7 and 8. The `any` type is bidirectional, whereas `unknown` is unidirectional.

The `unknown` type can be helpful in cases where you don‚Äôt know the type of a value you are passing into a function but would like to get rid of the `any` cases. This increases the safety of your code, as the `any` type can propagate, making your codebase more prone to errors.



### `strictNullChecks`

In TypeScript, `null` and `undefined` are assignable to every type, meaning that they are in the domain of all types.



`let num: number = 123;`

`num = null; // Okay`

`num = undefined; // Okay`



Oftentimes, this can lead to unexpected errors, as you can call methods on a variable whose value is `null` or `undefined`.

`interface Person {`

 `hello(): void;`

`}`

`const num: number = undefined;`

`const str: string = null;`

`const person: Person = null;`

`person.hello(); // üî¥ Runtime Error!`



In strict null checking mode, `null` and `undefined` do not automatically belong to all types, and therefore you can‚Äôt use them for a type that doesn‚Äôt include `null` or `undefined`. This way, you can get an error at compile time that says `Object is possibly 'undefined'`.

# TypeScript - Type Annotations

```tsx
var age: number = 32; // number variable
var name: string = "John";// string variable
var isUpdated: boolean = true;// Boolean variable
```

#### The following example demonstrates the type annotation of paramters.

```
function display(id:number, name:string)
{
    console.log("Id = " + id + ", Name = " + name);
}
```

#### Similarly, we can declare an object with inline annotations for each of the properties of the object.

```tsx
var employee : { 
    id: number; 
    name: string; 
}; 

employee = { 
  id: 100, 
  name : "John"
}
```

### Union type

Oftentimes, you may want your code to allow more than one data type. This need is especially true when accepting a `null` or `undefined` value. The **union type** can solve this problem, which is denoted by the `|` annotation.

`const hello = (name: string | undefined) => { /* ... */ };`



In this example, the type `name` is defined as `string | undefined`, meaning that any variable of type `name` can either be a `string` or `undefined`.

### Intersection type

An intersection type combines multiple types into one, such that the new type has the features of the combined types. You can do this through the `extend` keyword, as seen below.

`function extend<T, U>(first: T, second: U): T & U {`

 `return { ...first, ...second };`

`}`

`const x = extend({ a: "hello" }, { b: 42 });`

`// x now has both a and b`

`const a = x.a;`

`const b = x.b;`



### Tuple type

Unlike JavaScript, TypeScript offers Tuple types, which allow you to express an array with non-uniform types and a fixed number of elements. A tuple is demonstrated in the below example.

`var nameNumber: [string, number];`

`// Okay`

`nameNumber = ['Ben', 12345];`

`// Error`

`nameNumber = ['Ben', '12345'];`



#### <u>We must know things on TypeScript</u>

## 1. TypeScript Code is Converted into Plain JavaScript Code

TypeScript code consists of plain JavaScript code as well as certain keywords and constructs specific to TypeScript. However, when you compile the TypeScript code it is converted into plain JavaScript. That means the resultant JavaScript can be used with any browser that supports JavaScript. For example, consider the following code written in TypeScript:

```
class Customer {
    customerId: number;
    companyName: string;
    contactName: string;
    country: string;

    addCustomer(): number {
        //some code here
        return 0;
    }
}
```

The above code uses TypeScript specific keywords such as *class* and data types such as *number* and *string*. When you compile this code the resultant JavaScript that gets outputted is this:

```
var Customer = (function () {
    function Customer() { }
    Customer.prototype.addCustomer = function () {
        return 0;
    };
    return Customer;
})();
```

As you can see this is just the plain JavaScript and can be used in any browser that understands JavaScript. In your web pages you will be referring to this JavaScript code file (*.js) and not the TypeScript code file (*.ts). To compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript you have two options ‚Äì you can either use the command line TypeScript compiler (tsc.exe) or you can use the TypeScript editor plugin for Visual Studio 2012. The later is highly recommended because it provides additional features such as IntelliSense and syntax highlighting.

## 2. Data Types

When you declare any variable in JavaScript you typically do so using var keyword without specifying any particular data type for the variable. For example consider the following variable declaration:

```
window.onload = function () {
    var data = 10;
    alert(data);
    data = "hello world";
    alert(data);
}
```

In the above piece of code, variable named data is first assigned a number and then a string. As you might have already guessed both the alert() calls correctly output the respective value. However, this can lead to hard to maintain code and can introduce serious errors. TypeScript allows you to declare variables with a specific data type. The types can be classified as primitive or object types. The primitive types include number, bool and string whereas object types include modules, classes and interfaces. The following piece of code shows how this can be done.

![Declare variables](https://devcomprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TypeScript-10-Figure01.png)

Declare variables

As you can see three variables viz. age, message and flag are declared of type number, string and bool respectively. If you try to assign values to any of these variables that are not of the specific type, the TypeScript compiler will throw an error. If you are using TypeScript editor plugin for Visual Studio 2012 you will immediately see a red underline below the line in question. You can omit the type if you declare and initialize the variable in a single step (for example, var age=10; will make age of type number). Types can also be used with function parameters or return values of the functions.

```
MyFunction(message:string,flag:bool): number {
    if (flag) {
        document.getElementById("div1").innerText = message;
        return 10;
    }
    else {
        document.getElementById("div1").innerText = message;
        return 20;
    }
}
```

As you can see, the MyFunction accepts two parameters of type string and bool respectively and returns a number. TypeScript also has a data type called any that can accept any type of data.

By allowing you to declare variables of a specific type, TypeScript avoids lot of errors that may otherwise be introduced in the code.

## 3. Classes

If you develop applications using programming languages such as C# or Visual Basic you are probably aware of the benefit offered by object oriented constructs such as classes. In many web applications developers keep their JavaSript code merely as a collection of functions. TypeScript allows you to easily and neatly organize your code in classes. The following class declaration shows how:

```
class Customer {
    customerId: number;
    companyName: string;

    addCustomer() {
        //some code here
    }

    removeCustomer() {
        //some code here
    }

    updateCustomer() {
        //some code here
    }

    getCustomer() {
        //some code here
    }
}
```

The above code creates a class named Customer using the class keyword of TypeScript. Just like C# classes a TypeScript class can have properties, methods and constructors. Once created you can initialize an object of Customer class as shown below:

```
var obj = new Customer();
obj.customerId = 100;
obj.companyName = "Some Company";
obj.addCustomer();
```

## 4. Access Modifiers and Properties

Access modifiers control the accessibility of the members of a class. TypeScript has two access modifiers ‚Äì public and private. By default the members are public but you can explicitly add a public or private modifier to them. Consider the following piece of code that declares two public and one private variable.

![Two public and one private variable](https://devcomprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TypeScript-10-Figure02.png)

Two public and one private variable

The above code defines a class named Customer that has three members viz. customerId, companyName and country. Since by default members are public the customerId can be accessed from theoutside world as shown by the IntelliSense window. On the same lines the companyName is explicitly marked as public and hence it is accessible from the external world. The country, however, is marked as private and hence won‚Äôt be accessible outside the class as can be seen from the IntelliSense window.

When you declare members as private you may want to allow access to them them via public get and set properties. Luckily TypeScript allows you to do just that. The following code shows how:

```
get Country(): string {
    return this.country;
}

set Country(value: string) {
    this.country = value;
}
```

Here, the get and a set functions for Country property are defined. Inside the get function you return the value of private variable country whereas in the set function you assign a value to it. Once created you can use this property as follows:

```
var obj = new Customer();
obj.Country = "USA";
```

Note that in order to compile the above code correctly you must use ‚Äìtarget switch and set its value to ES5 (ECMA script version 5). This is because the property get and set are supported in ECMA5 and later versions (the error thrown at you will be ‚ÄúProperty accessors are only available when targeting ES5 or greater‚Äù). To compile the above code from the command line you would run the following command:

```
tsc.exe --target ES5 app.ts
```

## 5. Static and Instance Members

The classes you create in TypeScript can either contain static members or instance members. For example consider the following piece of code:

```
class Customer {
    customerId: number;
    companyName: string;
    static data: string;

    static test() {
        alert(Customer.data);
    }
}
```

The above code declares a class named Customer. The Customer class declares a static property ‚Äì data ‚Äì of type string. The static function test() then displays this property value to the user. Notice how static members are accessed using <class_name>.<static_member_name> syntax.

## 6. Function Overloading

TypeScript allows you to define overloaded functions. This way you can invoke different implementations of a function depending on the parameter. Remember, however, that TypeScript function overloading is bit odd and requires type checking during the implementation. This limitation is due to the fact that TypeScript code finally gets compiled into plain JavaScript and JavaScript doesn‚Äôt support the concept of function overloading in its true sense. The following simple example shows how two versions of a function can be created in TypeScript:

```
addCustomer(custId: number);
addCustomer(company:string);
addCustomer(value: any) {
    if (value && typeof value == "number") {
        alert("First overload - " + value);
    }
    if (value && typeof value == "string") {
        alert("Second overload - " + value);
    }
}
```

As you can see the first two are merely function signatures without any implementation. The first signature has one parameter of type number whereas the second signature has a parameter of type string. The third function contains the actual implementation and has a parameter of type any. The any data type indicates that any type of data can be passed in the parameter. The implementation then has a series of if blocks, each checking the type of the supplied parameter. Accordingly a different piece of code is executed. If you see the IntelliSense for the addCustomer() function it will indicate all the overloaded versions of the function as shown below:

![The IntelliSense for the addCustomer() function](https://devcomprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TypeScript-10-Figure03.png)

The IntelliSense for the addCustomer() function

## 7. Constructors

The classes you define in TypeScript can have constructor. The constructor usually does the job of initializing the object by setting default values to its properties. The constructor can also be overloaded just like a function. The following code shows how a constructor can be created.

```
constructor(custId:number,company:string,country:string) {
    this.customerId = custId;
    this.companyName = company;
    this.country = country;
}
```

The above code declares a parameterized constructor for the Customer class. The constructor has three parameters and inside the constructor their values are assigned to the respective properties. Once created you can instantiate the Customer class as shown below:

```
var obj = new Customer(100,'Some Company','USA');
alert(obj.country);
```

As you can see the constructor parameters are specified while instantiating the class. There is also one more handy use of the constructor ‚Äì instead of defining properties explicitly in the class they can be defined in the constructor signature itself. The following code shows how this can be done:

```
constructor(public customerId:number,public companyName:string,public country:string) {
}
```

The above constructor has three parameters and they are marked as public. This way the Customer class gets three public properties, viz. customerId, companyName and country, even if you didn‚Äôt explicitly defined them. You can then use these properties just like any other explicitly defined properties.



## 8. Inheritance

TypeScript allows you to inherit from existing classes. By inheriting classes you can extend their functionality as per your requirement. For example, you may have a class named Person. You can create specialized classes based on the Person class by extending it in the other classes (say Employee or Contractor). The following code shows how this can be done.

![TypeScript allows you to inherit from existing classes](https://devcomprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TypeScript-10-Figure04.png)

TypeScript allows you to inherit from existing classes

The above code defines two classes Person and Employee. The Person class has two properties viz. firstName and lastName. The Employee class inherits from the Person class using the extends keyword. Notice how the base class constructor has been called in the inherited class using the super keyword. As shown in the IntelliSense the Employee class in all has four properties ‚Äì two properties from base class and two properties of its own.

## 9. Interfaces

Just as TypeScript supports inheritance, it also supports interfaces. You can define an interface and then implement it in one or more classes. For example, you may have an interface called ITax that defines some properties and functions. You can then implement ITax in other classes say IncomeTax and ServiceTax. The following code shows how this can be done:

```
interface ITax {
    taxpayerId: string;
    calculateTax(): number;
}

class IncomeTax implements ITax {
    taxpayerId: string;
    calculateTax(): number {
        return 10000;
    }
}

class ServiceTax implements ITax {
    taxpayerId: string;
    calculateTax(): number {
        return 2000;
    }
}
```

As you can see from the above code an interface ITax has been defined using the interface keyword. It has one property named taxpayerId and a function calculateTax(). Then there is a class IncomeTax that implements ITax using the implements keyword. It is mandatory for IncomeTax class to implement taxpayerId property and the calculateTax() method. Similarly, another class named ServiceTax implements ITax.

#### TypeScript - Interfaces with Optional Properties

Interfaces with optional properties are written similar to other interfaces, with each optional property denoted by a **?** at the end of the property name in the declaration.

#### Example

#### optional-properties.ts

```
interface Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    phone?: string;
}

let p: Person = {name: "Ashlee", age: 29};
console.log(p);
```

#### Output

```
{ name: 'Ashlee', age: 29 }
```

If we don't use ? with property 'phone':

#### without-optional-properties.ts

```
interface Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    phone: string;
}

let p: Person = {name: "Ashlee", age: 29};
console.log(p);
```

#### Output

```
without-optional-properties.ts(7,5): error TS2322: Type '{ name: string; age: number; }' is not assignable to type 'Person'.
  Property 'phone' is missing in type '{ name: string; age: number; }'.
```

## 10. Modules

As your TypeScript code base grows it becomes important to organize classes and interfaces for better maintainability. TypeScript modules allow you to do just that. A module is a container for your code that helps you organize your code in a neat way. Conceptually you may find them similar to .NET namespaces. Let‚Äôs see how to create a module.

Have a look at the following code that defines a module named Company.

```
module Company {
    class Employee {
    }

    class EmployeeHelper {
        targetEmployee: Employee;
    }

    export class Customer {
    }
}

var obj = new Company.Customer();
```

The above code defines Company module using the module keyword. The Company module contains three classes ‚Äì Employee, EmployeeHelper and Customer. By default all the classes from a module are accessible only within that module. That is why it is alright to access the Employee class inside the EmployeeHelper class from the same module but you can‚Äôt access the Employee class from outside the Company module. If you wish to access a class from a module from the outside world you need to ‚Äúexport‚Äù it as in the case of the Customer class.

# Interface Extending Interfaces

In TypeScript, an interface can extend other interfaces as well. One interface can extend multiple interfaces at a time.



```tsx
interface Component {
    w: number;
    h: number;
    enableEvents(enable: boolean): void;
}

interface Button extends Component {
    label: string;
}

//implementing extended interface
class RadioButton implements Button {
    h: number;
    label: string;
    w: number;
    private enable: boolean;

    constructor(h: number, w: number, label: string) {
        this.h = h;
        this.w = w;
        this.label = label;
    }

    enableEvents(enable: boolean): void {
        this.enable = enable;
    }
}
let radioButton: Button = new RadioButton(100, 20, "test");
radioButton.enableEvents(true)
console.log(radioButton);
```

#### Output

```
RadioButton { h: 100, w: 20, label: 'test', enable: true }
```

#### extending-interfaces.js

```ts
class RadioButton {
    constructor(h, w, label) {
        this.h = h;
        this.w = w;
        this.label = label;
    }
    enableEvents(enable) {
        this.enable = enable;
    }
}
let radioButton = new RadioButton(100, 20, "test");
radioButton.enableEvents(true);
console.log(radioButton);
```



# Interface as Functions

## Function that accepts an argument:

Include the argument name and its type. The argument name is required but does not have to match when you instantiate the real function, but the type does have to match. It‚Äôs *duck typed* as is everything in Typescript.

```tsx
interface MyClassProps {
    anotherProp: number;
    onChange(name: string): any;
}
```

##  Function that accepts an argument and returns a value:

This function accepts a string as an argument and returns a number.

```tsx
interface MyClassProps {
    onChange(name: string): number;
}tsx
```

## Function that is optional:

Suffix the property name with the Optional Operator `?`. Put the `?` after the property name and before the argument list. In TypeScript React all props are required unless you use the Optional Operator. As with any non-required prop in React you‚Äôll have to check if the prop is `undefined`before using it.

```tsx
interface MyClassProps {
    onChange?(name: string): number;
    niceProp: boolean;tsx
}
```

## Using the type keyword:

Sometimes it‚Äôs convenient to declare the function‚Äôs type first, then use the type in an interface. To declare a function as a type the syntax is slightly different. Use the arrow operator.

```tsx
type MyFunctionType = (name: string) => number;interface MyClassProps {
    onChange: MyFunctionType;
    niceProp: string;
}
```



# Decorators in TypeScript



*Decorators* are a way to decorate members of a class, or a class itself, with extra functionality. When you apply a decorator to a class or a class member, you are actually calling a function that is going to receive details of what is being decorated, and the decorator implementation will then be able to transform the code dynamically, adding extra functionality, and reducing boilerplate code. They are a way to have metaprogramming in TypeScript, which is a programming technique that enables the programmer to create code that uses other code from the application itself as data.

## Types of decorators

In TypeScript, decorators are functions that can be attached to classes and their members, such as methods and properties. Let‚Äôs look at some examples.

### Class decorator

When you attach a function to a class as a decorator, you‚Äôll receive the class constructor as the first parameter.

```
const classDecorator = (target: Function) => {
  // do something with your class
}

@classDecorator
class Rocket {}
```

If you want to override the properties within the class, you can return a new class that extends its constructor and set the properties.

```
const addFuelToRocket = (target: Function) => {
  return class extends target {
    fuel = 100
  }
}

@addFuelToRocket
class Rocket {}
```

Now your `Rocket` class will have a `fuel` property with a default value of `100`.

```
const rocket = new Rocket()
console.log((rocket).fuel) // 100
```

### Method decorator

Another good place to attach a decorator is the class method. Here, you‚Äôre getting three parameters in your function: `target`, `propertyKey`, and `descriptor`.

```
const myDecorator = (target: Object, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) =>  {
  // do something with your method
}

class Rocket {
  @myDecorator
  launch() {
    console.log("Launching rocket in 3... 2... 1... üöÄ")
  }
}
```

The first parameter contains the class where this method lives, which, in this case, is the `Rocket` class. The second parameter contains your method name in string format, and the last parameter is the property descriptor, a set of information that defines a property behavior. This can be used to observe, modify, or replace a method definition.

The method decorator can be very useful if you want to extend the functionality of your method, which we‚Äôll cover later.

### Property decorator

Just like the method decorator, you‚Äôll get the `target` and `propertyKey` parameter. The only difference is that you don‚Äôt get the property descriptor.

```
const propertyDecorator = (target: Object, propertyKey: string) => {
  // do something with your property
}
```

There are several other places to attach your decorators in TypeScript, but that‚Äôs beyond the scope of this article. If you‚Äôre curious, you can read more about it in the [TypeScript docs](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/A-practical-guide-to-TypeScript-decorators--Az3eBblNHj5Doz3Z4NyijRAuAQ-7CB7irprCVgmPH1mS0mY4).

## Use cases for TypeScript decorators

Now that we‚Äôve covered what decorators are and how to use them properly, let‚Äôs take a look at some specific problems decorators can help us solve.

### **Calculate** **e**xecution **t**ime

Let‚Äôs say you want to estimate how long it takes to run a function as a way to gauge your application performance. You can create a decorator to calculate the execution time of a method and print it on the console.

```
class Rocket {
  @measure
  launch() {
    console.log("Launching in 3... 2... 1... üöÄ");
  }
}
```

The `Rocket` class has a `launch` method inside of it. To measure the execution time of the `launch` method, you can attach the `measure` decorator.

```
import { performance } from "perf_hooks";

const measure = (
  target: Object,
  propertyKey: string,
  descriptor: PropertyDescriptor
) => {
  const originalMethod = descriptor.value;

  descriptor.value = function (...args) {
    const start = performance.now();
    const result = originalMethod.apply(this, args);
    const finish = performance.now();
    console.log(`Execution time: ${finish - start} milliseconds`);
    return result;
  };

  return descriptor;
};
```

As you can see, the `measure` decorator replaces the original method with a new one that enables it to calculate the execution time of the original method and log it to the console.

To calculate the execution time, we‚Äôll use the [Performance Hooks API](https://nodejs.org/api/perf_hooks.html) from the Node.js standard library.

Instantiate a new `Rocket` instance and call the `launch` method.

```
const rocket = new Rocket();
rocket.launch();
```

You‚Äôll get the following result.

```
Launching in 3... 2... 1... üöÄ
Execution time: 1.0407989993691444 milliseconds
```

### Decorator factory

To configure your decorators to act differently in a certain scenario, you can use a concept called decorator factory.

Decorator factory is a function that returns a decorator. This enables you to customize the behavior of your decorators by passing some parameters in the factory.

Take a look at the example below.

```
const changeValue = (value) => (target: Object, propertyKey: string) => {
  Object.defineProperty(target, propertyKey, { value });
};
```

The `changeValue` function returns a decorator that change the value of the property based on the value passed from your factory.

```
class Rocket {
  @changeValue(100)
  fuel = 50
}

const rocket = new Rocket()
console.log(rocket.fuel) // 100
```

Now, if you bind your decorator factory to the `fuel` property, the value will be `100`.

### Automatic error guard

Let‚Äôs implement what we‚Äôve learned to solve a real-world problem.

```
class Rocket {
  fuel = 50;

  launchToMars() {
    console.log("Launching to Mars in 3... 2... 1... üöÄ");
  }
}
```

Let‚Äôs say you have a `Rocket` class that has a `launchToMars` method. To launch a rocket to Mars, the fuel level must be above 100.

Let‚Äôs create the decorator for it.

```
const minimumFuel = (fuel: number) => (
  target: Object,
  propertyKey: string,
  descriptor: PropertyDescriptor
) => {
  const originalMethod = descriptor.value;

  descriptor.value = function (...args) {
    if (this.fuel > fuel) {
      originalMethod.apply(this, args);
    } else {
      console.log("Not enough fuel!");
    }
  };

  return descriptor;
}; 
```

The `minimumFuel` is a factory decorator. It takes the `fuel` parameter, which indicates how much fuel is needed to launch a particular rocket.

To check the fuel condition, wrap the original method with a new method, just like in the previous use case.

Now you can plug your decorator to the `launchToMars` method and set the minimum fuel level.

```
class Rocket {
  fuel = 50;

  @minimumFuel(100)
  launchToMars() {
    console.log("Launching to Mars in 3... 2... 1... üöÄ");
  }
}
```

Now if you invoke the `launchToMars` method, it won‚Äôt launch the rocket to Mars because the current fuel level is 50.

```
const rocket = new Rocket()
rocket.launchToMars()


Not enough fuel!
```

The cool thing about this decorator is that you can apply the same logic into a different method without rewriting the whole if-else statement.

Let‚Äôs say you want to make a new method to launch the rocket to the moon. To do that, the fuel level must be above 25.

Repeat the same code and change the parameter.

```
class Rocket {
  fuel = 50;

  @minimumFuel(100)
  launchToMars() {
    console.log("Launching to Mars in 3... 2... 1... üöÄ");
  }

  @minimumFuel(25)
  launchToMoon() {
    console.log("Launching to Moon in 3... 2... 1... üöÄ")
  }
}
```

Now, this rocket can be launched to the moon.

```
const rocket = new Rocket()
rocket.launchToMoon()


Launching to Moon in 3... 2... 1... üöÄ
```

This type of decorator can be very useful for authentication and authorization purposes, such as checking whether a user is allowed to access some private data or not.





# Generics

A major part of software engineering is building components that not only have well-defined and consistent APIs, but are also reusable. Components that are capable of working on the data of today as well as the data of tomorrow will give you the most flexible capabilities for building up large software systems.

It‚Äôll be easier to explain TypeScript generics through a simple example.

Suppose you need to develop a function that returns a random element in an array of number.

The following `getRandomNumberElement()` function takes an array of numbers as its parameter and returns a random element from the array:

```
function getRandomNumberElement(items: number[]): number {
    let randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * items.length);
    return items[randomIndex];
}Code language: TypeScript (typescript)
```

To get a random element of an array, you need to:

- Find the random index first.
- Get the random element based on the random index.

To find the random index of an array, we used the `Math.random()` that returns a random number between 0 and 1, multiplied it with the length of the array, and applied the `Math.floor()` on the result.

The following shows how to use the `getRandomNumberElement()` function:

```
let numbers = [1, 5, 7, 4, 2, 9];
console.log(getRandomNumberElement(numbers));Code language: TypeScript (typescript)
```

Assuming that you need to get a random element from an array of strings This time, you may come up with a new function:

```
function getRandomStringElement(items: string[]): string {
    let randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * items.length);
    return items[randomIndex];
}Code language: TypeScript (typescript)
```

The logic of the `getRandomStringElement()` function is the same as the one in the `getRandomNumberElement()` function.

This example shows how to use the `getRandomStringElement()` function:

```
let colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
console.log(getRandomStringElement(colors));Code language: TypeScript (typescript)
```

Later you may need to get a random element in an array of objects. Creating a new function every time you want to get a random element from a new array type is not scalable.

### Using the any type

One solution for this issue is to set the type of the array argument as `any[]`. By doing this, you need to write just one function that works with an array of any type.

```
function getRandomAnyElement(items: any[]): any {
    let randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * items.length);
    return items[randomIndex];
}Code language: TypeScript (typescript)
```

The `getRandomAnyElement()` works with an array of the `any` type including an array of numbers, strings, objects, etc.:

```
let numbers = [1, 5, 7, 4, 2, 9];
let colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];

console.log(getRandomAnyElement(numbers));
console.log(getRandomAnyElement(colors));Code language: TypeScript (typescript)
```

This solution works fine. However, it has a drawback.

It doesn‚Äôt allow you to enforce the type of the returned element. In other words, it isn‚Äôt type-safe.

A better solution to avoid code duplication while preserving the type is to use generics.

### TypeScript generics come to rescue

The following shows a generic function that returns the random element from an array of type `T`:

```
function getRandomElement<T>(items: T[]): T {
    let randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * items.length);
    return items[randomIndex];
}Code language: TypeScript (typescript)
```

This function uses type variable `T`. The `T` allows you to capture the type that is provided at the time of calling the function. Also, the function uses the `T` type variable as its return type.

This `getRandomElement()` function is generic because it can work with any data type including string, number, objects,‚Ä¶

By convention, we use the letter `T` as the type variable. However, you can freely use other letters such as `A`, `B` `C`, ‚Ä¶

## Calling a generic function

The following shows how to use the `getRandomElement()` with an array of numbers:

```
let numbers = [1, 5, 7, 4, 2, 9];
let randomEle = getRandomElement<number>(numbers); 
console.log(randomEle);Code language: TypeScript (typescript)
```

This example explicitly passes `number` as the `T` type into the `getRandomElement()` function.

In practice, you‚Äôll use <u>type inference</u> for the argument. It means that you let the TypeScript compiler set the value of `T` automatically based on the type of argument that you pass into, like this:

```
let numbers = [1, 5, 7, 4, 2, 9];
let randomEle = getRandomElement(numbers); 
console.log(randomEle);Code language: TypeScript (typescript)
```

In this example, we didn‚Äôt pass the `number` type to the `getRandomElement()` explicitly. The compiler just looks at the argument and sets `T` to its type.

Now, the `getRandomElement()` function is also type-safe. For example, if you assign the returned value to a string variable, you‚Äôll get an error:

```
let numbers = [1, 5, 7, 4, 2, 9];
let returnElem: string;
returnElem = getRandomElement(numbers);  // compiler errorCode language: TypeScript (typescript)
```

## Generic functions with multiple types

The following illustrates how to develop a generic function with two type variables `U` and `V`:

```
function merge<U, V>(obj1: U, obj2: V) {
    return {
        ...obj1,
        ...obj2
    };
}Code language: JavaScript (javascript)
```

The `merge()` function merges two objects with the type `U` and `V`. It combines the properties of the two objects into a single object.

Type inference infers the returned value of the `merge()` function as an intersection type of `U` and `V`, which is `U & V`

The following illustrates how to use the `merge()` function that merges two objects:

```
let result = merge(
    { name: 'John' },
    { jobTitle: 'Frontend Developer' }
);

console.log(result);Code language: JavaScript (javascript)
```

Output:

```
{ name: 'John', jobTitle: 'Frontend Developer' }Code language: CSS (css)
```

## Benefits of TypeScript generics

The following are benefits of TypeScript generics:

- Leverage type checks at the compile time.
- Eliminate **type castings**
- Allow you to implement generic algorithms.



### Rest Properties

Rest properties collect the remaining own enumerable property keys that are not already picked off by the destructuring pattern. Those keys and their values are copied onto a new object.

```
let { x, y, ...z } = { x: 1, y: 2, a: 3, b: 4 };
x; // 1
y; // 2
z; // { a: 3, b: 4 }
```

### Spread Properties

###### Spread properties in object initializers copies own enumerable properties from a provided object onto the newly created object.

```
let n = { x, y, ...z };
n; // { x: 1, y: 2, a: 3, b: 4 }
```
